In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. <i>Bon Appetit!</i></p><p>The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.</p><p>If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at <a href="example link">jen@example.com.</a></p><p><a href="jen.html">Go back</a></p></body></html>
